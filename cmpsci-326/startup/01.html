<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>UCombinator requires that each startup submit a product <em>pitch</em> that
explains the product that your startup wants to develop over the
course of the semester.</p>

<p>Your product needs to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Be a desktop web application.</strong> UCombinator specializes in web
applications, and will not accept other types of applications. In
addition, mobile web applications are strictly trickier than desktop
web applications, so UCombinator would rather see desktop web
applications.
    <ul>
      <li>UCombinator will let startups write mobile web applications if
they demonstrate that they have the ability to execute them
without additional support.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Use React, Bootstrap, Node.js, and MongoDB.</strong> UCombinator
specializes in these four technologies, and will not accept startups
using alternative software stacks.
    <ul>
      <li>Startups can use helper libraries where appropriate, but must use
these four core technologies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Support multiple user accounts.</strong> Your product should let users
create and log into their own accounts. Although we will mostly be
focusing on a single login environment for most of the semester, the
product and pitch must be a multi-user application.</li>
  <li><strong>Use a database.</strong> Your product needs to store information,
including user account information, in a database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your product cannot:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Be a game.</strong> UCombinator does not consider games to be web
applications.  The skills required to create an online game are very
different from the skills required to create a web application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your product does not:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Need a profit plan.</strong> Startups like Twitter and Facebook began
with an interesting idea, but no immediate plans for profit. They
launched and operated for years without advertising. UCombinator
does not care or need to know if your idea would be
profitable. However, to simulate reality your team should consider
how your could profit and be ready to answer that question during
the pitch party at the end of the semester.</li>
</ul>

<p>The pitch should have a minimum of 1” margins on all sides (Microsoft
Word’s default setting), be written in a 12-point font, and be
single-sided. No extra space will be allotted. Use of the Helvetica
font is encouraged, but not required.</p>

<h2 id="grading-rubric">Grading Rubric</h2>

<p>UCombinator will grade the pitch using the following rubric:</p>

<ul>
  <li>25% Clearly written</li>
  <li>25% Displays a clear understanding of the idea underlying the product</li>
  <li>25% Contains a brief description of the product’s relationship to existing applications
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example 1</strong>: TikTak lets you anonymously and privately tell
friends that their breath needs freshening.  TikTak is similar to
YikYak in that you can only share messages with users in the
surrounding physical area.  Unlike YikYak, TikTak messages are
sent privately to individuals, and only concern the person’s
breath.</li>
      <li><strong>Example 2</strong>: Chairity lets you list furniture that you would
like to give away. Like eBay, Chairity lets you drill down into
the category of item you want. Like Craigslist, Chairity is
focused on <em>local</em> transactions, as users must pick up items that
they want.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>25% Contains a brief overview of the technical challenges of the
product, and how you plan to overcome them
    <ul>
      <li>Examples of technical challenges:
        <ul>
          <li>Your product involves managing multimedia or some other
complicated type of data, and a library exists to do that.</li>
          <li>Your product interacts with an external service
(e.g. Twitter), that service has a free-to-use API that
contain the functionality you need, and someone in your
startup has used that API before.</li>
          <li>Your product needs to use a complicated algorithm, which a
member of your startup is deeply familiar with.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If UCombinator finds your pitch unsatisfactory, or has doubts that
your startup could complete the product within a semester, UCombinator
will council with your team and potentially require a second, updated
pitch.</p>

<h1 id="honors-student-feature-pitch">Honors Student Feature Pitch</h1>

<p><em>Separate from the product pitch</em>, each honors student on your startup
must write up a pitch for a product feature that they will develop
independently.</p>

<p>The feature must:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Require end-to-end changes to the product.</strong> In other words, the
feature needs to require custom HTML/CSS, server logic (e.g. for
fetching/modifying data associated with the feature), and new types
of data in the database.</li>
  <li><strong>Be reasonably isolated from the rest of the product.</strong> Your
startup should not need to maintain any of the honors students’
code, or be encumbered by it.  If an honors student is running
behind on their feature, it should not hold up the rest of the
startup in any way. Similarly, if the startup is running behind on
the product, it should not hold up the honors student.</li>
  <li><strong>Be implemented entirely by you.</strong> While honors students can (and
should!)  consult with their fellow startup members, they must
implement the feature themselves.</li>
  <li><strong>Make sense for your startup’s product.</strong> This should be
self-explanatory.</li>
  <li><strong>Be approved by your startup’s members.</strong> If the idea is
contentious, and not all startup members agree, it must be decided
by majority vote. The honors student must abstain from the voting
process.</li>
</ul>

<p>The feature cannot:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Be a game.</strong> For the same reasons why a startup’s product cannot
be a game.</li>
</ul>

<p>The honors pitch should have a minimum of 1” margins on all sides
(Microsoft Word’s default setting), be written in a 12-point font, and
be single-sided. No extra space will be allotted. Use of the Helvetica
font is encouraged, but not required. Your document needs to have
signatures from <strong>every member of the startup</strong>, affirming the
following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We, the undersigned, do hereby affirm that we have read the above
pitch describing a product feature (subsequently referred to as THE
FEATURE), and declare that 1) THE FEATURE is appropriate for our
startup’s product, 2) implementation of THE FEATURE will not impact
the main product’s development, 3) (name of honors student) is
solely responsible for designing and developing THE FEATURE, and 4)
members of the startup other than (name of honors student) will not
help implement THE FEATURE.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="honors-grading-rubric">Honors Grading Rubric</h2>

<p>UCombinator will grade the pitch using the following rubric:</p>

<ul>
  <li>25% Clearly written</li>
  <li>25% Displays a clear understanding of the idea underlying the
feature</li>
  <li>25% Contains a brief description of the feature’s relationship to
the startup’s product as a whole
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example 1</strong>: This feature adds <em>live chat support</em> to
TikTak. While TikTak simply lets you tell friends that their
breath needs freshening, TikTak FreshChat™ gives you the option of
opening up a meaningful, anonymous, two-way dialog about the
merits of fresh breath.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>25% Contains a brief overview of the technical challenges of the
feature, and how the honors student plans to overcome them</li>
</ul>

<p>If UCombinator finds an honors student’s pitch unsatisfactory, or has
doubts that they could complete the feature within a semester,
UCombinator will council with the startup and potentially require a
second, updated pitch.</p>

<h2 id="example-honors-features">Example Honors Features</h2>

<p>Here are examples of <em>bad</em> and <em>good</em> features.</p>

<p><strong>BAD FEATURES:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>A feature that adds photo posts to a Facebook clone.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This feature is not <em>reasonably isolated</em> from the product.  In
order to implement photo posts, the honors student will need to
modify the Facebook clone’s core posting logic. If the honors
student makes a mistake or implements the feature poorly, it will
impact the product’s core feature set. In addition, if the startup
fails to implement the core posting logic in a timely manner, it
will hold up the honors student’s progress.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>A feature that adds the choice of a more condensed news feed to a Facebook clone.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This feature is not <em>end-to-end</em>. It does not require any
meaningful database changes, and may not even require any server
changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>GOOD FEATURES:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>A feature that adds chat support to a Facebook clone.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This feature is <em>end-to-end</em>, as it stores chats in the database
and requires a chatting interface. It is also isolated from the
core product. It uses Facebook users in the database, but
otherwise maintains separate data.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>A feature that lets users view a slideshow of nearby cat pictures
on SnapCat.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This feature is <em>end-to-end</em>, as it requires database changes to
store SnapCats by location and a frontend for viewing those
SnapCats. While it uses data produced by the core product, it can
be developed independently with sample data while the startup
works on the core product features.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>A feature that lets users subscribe/unsubscribe to email
notifications.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This feature is <em>end-to-end</em>, as it requires an interface for
managing notification settings, database changes to store
notification settings, and server logic for emailing
notifications.  While the feature will need to integrate with core
product features, the integration should be trivial (e.g. an extra
function call) and should be easily worked around should the
honors student not deliver on the feature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="submission">Submission</h1>

<p>You must submit a PDF of your startup’s product pitch as well as any
honors feature pitches by the assigned due date on Moodle. Only one
member of your team needs to submit to Moodle.</p>
