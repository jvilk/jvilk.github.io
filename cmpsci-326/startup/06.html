</ul>

<p>In this submission, you will replace your mock server with a <em>real</em>
server, using Express and Node.JS. You will perform the same procedure
for your startup project as you did for Facebook in Workshop 9. We
urge startups to pay attention to the <strong>grade rubric</strong> – as in prior
assignments, we will grade your submission according to that rubric.</p>

<p>If your startup followed all of the guidelines of the previous submission,
you will likely find this submission to be much less work than the last!
However, if your startup had trouble last submission, you are going to
need to do extra work to fix those problems before adding a server.</p>

<p>Most of the components of this submission mirror the changes you had
to do to Facebook for Workshop 9.  Below, we break down what you need
to do for this submission.</p>

<h2 id="fix-issues-with-previous-submission">Fix Issues with Previous Submission</h2>

<p>You should attempt to fix all of the <strong>major</strong> bugs and issues present
in your previous submission.  Critically, if your dynamic mockup
submission <strong>did not use the server correctly</strong>, you need to fix this
issue before you are able to use a real server.</p>

<p>Specifically, before you can even add a real server, the client-side
of your project <strong>must</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Use the mock server and mock database appropriately.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are not using <code class="highlighter-rouge">emulateServerReturn</code> in your server methods,
you will not be able to migrate that server method to the real
server.  There is no way to write a server method that uses
<code class="highlighter-rouge">return</code> to send data to your application. It is all callback
based.</li>
      <li>It is unacceptable to use database functions like
<code class="highlighter-rouge">readDocument</code>/<code class="highlighter-rouge">writeDocument</code>/etc directly in your components or
helper modules.  You can only use these methods in the mock
server. Moreover, in this submission, you are moving the database
from the client to the server, so you will be forced to make this
change regardless.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Be dynamic, and not include any hardcoded data except for the ID
of the currently logged-in user.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>only</strong> exceptions are static pages, like FAQ pages, that do
not need to read from the database.</li>
      <li>If your server submission includes hardcoded data in your React
components, expect heavy penalties.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Have functioning forms.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have a form to, say, update a user’s profile or write a
status update, submitting the form should appropriately update the
database. The result should be visible somewhere in the UI, if
applicable.</li>
      <li>Some forms do not update the database or have a visual impact on
the UI. For example, email forms merely send an email using the
server.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should also consider fixing the following issues, which are not
blockers to adding a server:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Implement missing features or remove dead links.</strong> If your product
has links to unimplemented features, consider implementing or
removing these features.  Make sure your product still has
sufficient complexity for each startup member to be responsible for
a HTTP route.
    <ul>
      <li>If you aren’t getting serious about implementing the feature
<em>now</em>, there’s not much time for you to implement it <em>later</em>!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are doing the above properly, you will not be marked down
significantly for small bugs or inconsistencies in your product so
long as they are mentioned in the report.</p>

<h2 id="http-resources-and-requests">HTTP Resources and Requests</h2>

<p>You should map the database entities that the application needs access
to to HTTP resources, like we do in Workshop 9.  For example, we map
users to HTTP resources at <code class="highlighter-rouge">/user/:userid</code>. We recommend that you
decide upon these resources as a group – otherwise, your startup may
use inconsistent HTTP resource paths!</p>

<p>Then, you should determine the HTTP requests to use for each of your
server functions in the client’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">server.js</code>.  Namely, you should
figure out:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What <em>verb</em> to use (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE…)</li>
  <li>What <em>resource</em> to target (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">/user/:userid</code>)</li>
  <li>What <em>body</em> to send with the request, if any.</li>
  <li>The expected <em>body</em> of the server’s response, if any.</li>
</ul>

<p>Workshop 9 walks through this process for all of the server functions
for Facebook. Your decisions here will impact the HTTP routes you
configure in Express.</p>

<h2 id="json-tokens-and-authentication">JSON Tokens and Authentication</h2>

<p>Around the same time as HTTP request planning, you should settle on a
format for your JSON web token. What information do you need to store
in the token to authenticate HTTP requests?</p>

<p>In Workshop 9, you implement a JSON web token that only contains the
user’s ID, which is all of the information Facebook requires to figure
out if a user has access to read/modify particular data in the
database. It is possible this information alone is sufficient for your
application, as well.</p>

<p>As in the workshop, you will use unencrypted and base64’d JSON tokens
for authentication. See the workshop for details on how to generate
these for the client, and how to use them on the server.</p>

<h2 id="express-http-routes">Express HTTP Routes</h2>

<p>After deciding the HTTP requests you need to support for your
application, implement them in the Express server.  Each startup
founder should be responsible for at least one HTTP route in the
server, stemming from a product feature they are responsible for (see
report and grade rubric sections for individual grade details).</p>

<p>Each HTTP route must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>(If it expects JSON in the body) Perform JSON schema validation on
the body of the HTTP request
    <ul>
      <li>You did this in the workshop for status updates and comments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(If applicable) Determines if the requester is authorized to make
the specified request using the JSON web token.
    <ul>
      <li>All of the HTTP routes in the workshop make this check.</li>
      <li>Naturally, if the request involves public data, you may not need
this check. But you will need to defend this decision in the
report.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Respond to the request with appropriate HTTP status code in the
event of a success / authentication failure / etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="client-reset-database-button">Client Reset Database Button</h2>

<p><em>Move</em> the code from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ResetDatabase</code> component in <code class="highlighter-rouge">database.js</code>
into its own JavaScript file. Change the component so it communicates
with the server to reset the database. You may re-use the code from
Workshop 9 to make this change.</p>

<p>In addition, implement an HTTP route on the server for resetting the
database, as we do in Workshop 9.</p>

<h2 id="client-database-removal">Client Database Removal</h2>

<p>As in Workshop 9, you will need to move your mock objects from your
client’s mock database to the server’s mock database.  Then, you will
need to change all of your mock server methods to communicate with
your Express server.</p>

<p>Once the transition from mock server to real server is complete,
<em>delete</em> the mock database from your client Git repository using <code class="highlighter-rouge">git
rm</code>. Your client should no longer need it.</p>

<h2 id="client-error-handling">Client Error Handling</h2>

<p>The client-side of your application must report server errors to the
user, much like Facebook in Workshop 9.  You may re-use some of the
code from Workshop 9. In particular, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sendXHR</code> helper and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ErrorBanner</code> will likely be useful!</p>

<p>Like in the workshop, if the following happens, the user should be
notified about it in some way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The server is not running.</li>
  <li>The server unexpectedly rejects a request with a non-successful
status code.</li>
  <li>The server fails to respond to a request in a timely fashion.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should try to do this early on, as it will make it much simpler to
debug server errors!</p>

<p>You can choose to crudely report the raw error details to the user,
like we do in Workshop 9, or you may attempt to make the errors more
user friendly. It’s up to you! :)</p>

<h2 id="expectations-for-search-email-forms-third-party-api-integration-and-other-features">Expectations for Search, Email Forms, Third Party API Integration, and Other Features</h2>

<p>In this submission, you should try to implement any of the
server-based features you have been putting off implementing.
<strong>Please make sure the other components of your submission are
complete before you start spending a significant amount of time on
these features</strong>; it is much more important that your product is using
the server properly than it is to implement these features!</p>

<p>We have updated the mock database so that it supports retrieving
collections, so you can emulate basic database queries to implement
search and other filtering requests.  The modified Facebook client in
Workshop 9 supports basic search using the new database
functionality. If your desired queries are complex, you can implement
a “dumbed down” version for now. For example, the Facebook client in
Workshop 9 only searches for text in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">content</code> of a Status Update,
and not the other fields.</p>

<p>If your product has a send email form, you should implement a route on
the server that actually sends the email.  We
recommend <a href="https://nodemailer.com/">NodeMailer</a> for this purpose. Be
careful: NodeMailer typically requires the username/password to an
email account to send email, and you should <strong>not</strong> commit this
information to GitHub! You may want to include instructions in the
report for how to configure your project so that the feature works.</p>

<p>If your server or client needs to communicate with an external API
(e.g. Spotify, GitHub, etc), you should start working to integrate
with that API. Many of you will likely discover that the API uses HTTP
requests, much like your startup product! We understand the difficulty
of working with a new API like this, and will understand if your final
submission has some rough edges. Please document any limitations.</p>

<p>If integration with a third party API proves too challenging, you can
change the design of your product to avoid the integration. For
example, if you planned to integrate with Amazon to grab a user’s
purchase history, you may change your product so users enter their
purchases manually into your app. Document any changes like this in
your report.</p>

<h2 id="report">Report</h2>

<p>Include a report in <code class="highlighter-rouge">reports/submission_06.pdf</code> in your client
repository with the following information.  Note that we are no longer
requiring you to include or update your ER diagram, but your product
will have issues if your objects are not structured properly! Keep in
mind the lessons from the workshop on data modeling as you design or
refactor objects in the database.</p>

<h3 id="report-http-requests--routes">Report: HTTP Requests / Routes</h3>

<p>In the report, include a list of HTTP routes implemented in the
server, and the mock server method that they replace. For each,
briefly describe:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>verb</em>, <em>target</em>, and <em>body</em> of the request.
    <ul>
      <li>Example: <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST /feeditem [feeddata]</code>, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">[feeddata]</code> is a
JSON object describing a Feed Item.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What the HTTP request does, and what mock server method it replaces.</li>
  <li>What resources the HTTP request creates/modifies/etc.
    <ul>
      <li>Examples: “Updates <code class="highlighter-rouge">/user/:userid</code>”, “Creates a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">/user</code>“…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Who is authorized to use the request
    <ul>
      <li>Example for <code class="highlighter-rouge">PUT /user/:userid userdata</code>: “A user with the
specified <code class="highlighter-rouge">:userid</code> can issue this request. Administrators can
also make this change on any <code class="highlighter-rouge">:userid</code>.”</li>
      <li>Example for <code class="highlighter-rouge">POST /feeditem feeddata</code>: “The body of the HTTP
request contains an “author” field containing a user ID. The
requester must have the same user ID.”</li>
      <li>If you have a hard time explaining it generally, feel free to
include examples. Example: “A user with ID 4 can issue a <code class="highlighter-rouge">PUT
/user/4</code>, but a user with a different ID cannot.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="report-special-server-setup-procedure">Report: Special Server Setup Procedure</h3>

<p>If your server has any advanced features that require additional setup
besides <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">node src/server.js</code>, include a section in
the report that describes how to set up these features. Include
details on how to tell if the feature is working properly.</p>

<h3 id="report-individual-contributions">Report: Individual Contributions</h3>

<p>Include a section that describes each startup founder’s
contribution. Each startup founder should be responsible for at least
one product feature and its HTTP route(s). Name the feature and the
HTTP routes that the founder implemented / was responsible for.</p>

<h3 id="report-lingering-bugs--issues--dropped-features">Report: Lingering Bugs / Issues / Dropped Features</h3>

<p>If your application has any lingering bugs, issues, or missing/dropped
features, include a section listing these.</p>

<h2 id="grading-rubric">Grading Rubric</h2>

<h1 id="updating-git-repository">Updating Git Repository</h1>

<p>Workshop 9’s repository contains two folders: <code class="highlighter-rouge">client</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">server</code>. One member of your startup needs to perform the following
tasks to update your repository to include the server component.</p>

<p>All startup members will need to re-run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> in both the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">client</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">server</code> folders to install the dependencies for the
client and the server.</p>

<p><em>Trivia: As you may notice from your GitHub repository name, we
initially expected to use separate GitHub repositories for client and
server. However, that raises some server configuration issues, so we
decided to avoid the issue by using one repository.</em></p>

<h2 id="move-client-files-into-client-folder">Move client files into <code class="highlighter-rouge">client</code> folder</h2>

<p>From within your current git repository, have one of the startup
founders run the following commands to move all of the client-side of
your application into a folder called <code class="highlighter-rouge">client</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ mkdir client
$ git mv README.md app build package.json webpack.config.js .gitignore .eslintrc client/
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now, all of the Git-tracked files for the client-side of your
application should be in a folder named <code class="highlighter-rouge">client</code>.  Note that we did
not move <code class="highlighter-rouge">node_modules</code>: That folder is <em>ignored</em> by Git, and should
not be included in your repository.</p>

<p>Test that this works by <code class="highlighter-rouge">cd</code>ing into <code class="highlighter-rouge">client</code>, re-running <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm
install</code> to re-create <code class="highlighter-rouge">node_modules</code>, then run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm run serve</code>. If all
works as inspected, <code class="highlighter-rouge">commit</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">push</code> your changes to GitHub.</p>

<p>The other founders of the startup are going to need to re-run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm
install</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">client</code> folder, since you have relocated the project.</p>

<h2 id="modify-clients-packagejson">Modify client’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code></h2>

<p>One of your startup founders should modify the <code class="highlighter-rouge">"script"</code> section of
<code class="highlighter-rouge">client/package.json</code> to the following:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>  <span class="s2">"scripts"</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">"serve"</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="s2">"webpack-dev-server --content-base build"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"watch"</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="s2">"webpack --watch"</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This will let you use <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm run watch</code> in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">client</code> repository,
which is the same command you used in the workshop to rebuild the
client-side of your application <em>without</em> running a webserver.</p>

<p>Verify that <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm run watch</code> works, then <code class="highlighter-rouge">commit</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">push</code> the change
to GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="add-a-server-folder">Add a <code class="highlighter-rouge">server</code> folder</h2>

<p>One startup member
should
<a href="/startups/startup-06/server.zip">download server.zip</a>,
and extract it into the Git repository. It should create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">server</code>
folder, with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> and other files. Add the folder to git:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git add server/
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Note that all startup founders must run <code class="highlighter-rouge">npm install</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">server/</code>
